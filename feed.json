The project was an opportunity to approach Unreal Engine for the first time, allowing me to become familiar with its interface, workflow, and technical management. I also explored programming through Blueprints, creating simple in-game interactions and understanding the logic behind real-time systems. As the team leader, I coordinated the group’s workflow and communication, ensuring consistency and efficiency throughout development. My main responsibilities included 3D modeling, texturing, and, above all, the technical management of Unreal Engine, handling project organization, scene setup, and optimization.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin: 0 auto; width: 80%;\">his experience was extremely valuable in improving my teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership skills, while deepening my understanding of the technical side of game production within Unreal Engine.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<div class=\"canva-wrapper\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" style=\"width: 811px; height: 456px; border: none; border-radius: 16px; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.canva.com/design/DAG2vG-W6Hk/eSBtCC4MP0_kqSOzlJ28WA/watch?embed\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div> </div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin: 0 auto; width: 80%;\"><!-- Contenitore responsive con stile --></p>\n<div class=\"canva-wrapper\"> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>",
